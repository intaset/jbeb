The investigators hypothesized that elevated frequencies alter normal mechanical response of facet joints which may be a mechanical predisposition for low back pain.  Facet joints from six bovine L4-L5 vertebra were subjected to 520 loading cycles from -15N to -60N at 1Hz, 5Hz, 20Hz, 40Hz and 80Hz. Net deformation, strain, cumulative strain, and elastic stiffness were computed for each cycle, averaged across frequencies and subjected to non-linear exponential regression. Regression parameters were examined with a Tukey post-hoc test.  Asymptotic limits of deformation were statistically significant (P&#60;0.005) while elevated frequencies displayed significant decreases with respect to deformation change per cycle as compared to 1Hz. (P&#60;0.005) Initial strain data indicated all frequency comparisons were statistically significant (P&#60;0.01. The strain change per cycle indicated 1Hz loading was statistically equivalent to both 40Hz and 80Hz loading (P>0.05). The 5Hz frequency was statistically elevated compared to other frequencies (P&#60;0.01). Initial stiffness indicated all frequency comparisons were statistically different (P&#60;0.05).  This study represents mechanical evidence for the predisposition of individuals exposed to high frequency loading toward increased incidence of load back pain.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction and Related Work</h4>

<p class="body">Societal lifestyle and occupational trends
combined with natural disc degeneration due to aging results in low back pain
affecting over 80% of Americans at some point in their lives [1]. The facet
joints have been recognized as a potential source of back pain since 1911 [2]. 
While this incidence rate may be relatively high, perhaps a more pertinent
observation involves those individuals who are exposed to elevated frequency
loading due to occupation. These include heavy equipment operators, commercial
truck drivers and helicopter pilots. A meta-risk analysis for development of
low back pain in this population indicated a propensity over twice that of
non-operators [3]. In animals, complications due to vibrational loading
include compromised nutrition, increased disc pressure, neuropeptide release,
and increased creep [4]. Feline models subjected to 60 minutes of cyclic
flexion-extension at 40N at 0.25Hz and 0.5Hz respectively, resulted in
significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#946;, IL-6, IL-8,
TNF-&#945;, TGF-&#946;1) at the higher loading frequency, indicating pronounced
changes consistent with an acute inflammation in the supraspinous ligaments of
L3-L4 and L5-L6 [5]. In humans, vibrational exposure has been related to low
back pain in addition to neck and shoulder pain. [6].</span></p>

<p class="body">Under certain conditions the effects of high
frequency vibration has been shown to provide benefit. Rats bilaterally
implanted with hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated titanium in tibiae were treated with
low-magnitude high-frequency loading via whole body vibration (VIB) or
alendronate (ALN) following ovariectomy. Both the VIB, ALN and sham animals
significantly increased bone-to-implant contact, peri-implant bone fraction and
biomechanical push out force and interfacial shear strength when compared with
the control ovariectomy group. The authors concluded that low-magnitude
high-frequency loading enhanced bone-to-implant osseointegration, but the efficacy
was weaker than alendronate [7]. Though a number of studies have been
conducted to evaluate vibrational transmission to the body, few have focused on
isolated spinal structures. One such study by Kaigle et al. investigated the
response of porcine intervertebral discs to compressive (100N and 200N)
vibrational loading from 0.05Hz to 25Hz. The results showed that dynamic axial
stiffness was frequency dependent and increased with successive exposures at
the same load magnitude [8]. </span></p>

<p class="body">Finite element analyses have been used
extensively to examine the effects upon spinal structures. Using a non-linear
finite element model of the L3-L5 spinal segment, Guo et al. examined the
frequency effects of axial cyclic loading on the spine. When exposed to long
term whole body vibration, the model indicated that the posterior regions of
intervertebral disc are more susceptible to injury as compared to anterior
regions. Further, the vibrational amplitudes displayed at the facet joint were
in excess of 200% of both the displacement and stress on vertebrae or discs [9]. 
Regarding implant performance, Kettler et al. investigated the wear rates of
Prodisc-L devices tested under ISO 18192-1 (Wear of total intervertebral spinal
disc prostheses -- Part 1: Loading and displacement parameters for wear testing
and corresponding environmental conditions for test) and found that testing at
2Hz resulted in increased wear as compared to the traditional 1Hz testing rate [10].
</span></p>

<p class="body">Several studies have concluded that the
resonance frequency of the spine is approximately 5Hz. [6,11,12]. While dynamic
evaluations of elevated frequency effects have been conducted few have examined
loading frequencies in excess of the resonance frequency [8]. One drawback to
whole body vibration is identifying the exact frequency and magnitude of load
applied to structures of interest. Through cyclic loading at these elevated
frequencies, one may investigate the temporal effects of elevated frequency
loading. Furthermore, using this temporal data, extrapolation to prolonged
exposure is possible, though it should be noted that under these in-vitro
conditions, one must also give some credence to specimen degradation as well as
the lack of physiological repair. </span></p>

<p class="body">In this paper the investigators applied cyclic
compression to spinal facet joints over a range of loading frequencies from the
physiologically accepted value of 1Hz to a high rate of 80Hz so as to span frequencies
encountered under occupational exposure. We hypothesized that elevated
frequency loading changes the mechanical response of the facet joint to loading. 
In doing so, the results indicated that elevated loading frequencies stiffened
the facet joint and indicated a continuous accumulation of strain at
frequencies beyond 1 Hz. These findings are mechanical evidence toward a
predisposition of those individuals associated with high frequency occupational
exposure for increased incidence of low back pain.</span></p>

<h4>2. Materials and Methods</h4>

<p class="body">Facet joints from six 100kg bovine L4-L5 vertebral
bodies (Animal Technologies Inc., Tyler, TX) were embedded in resin and secured
to a mechanism that permitted translation and rotation in the X-Y plane to
allow perpendicular alignment of the test surface to the loading axis. Each
loading site was subjected to 520 loading cycles from -15N (19MPa) to -60N
(76MPa) using a 1mm diameter indentor (Figure 1).</p>

</figure>

<p class="body">Previous work has shown that continuous loading
over extended cycles can lead to specimen degradation. These testing
parameters are comparable to those cited by Zioupos et.al, where specimens
under 80MPa were failing at approximately 550 cycles using human cortical bone
[13]. Load versus deformation data was recorded at cycle 5 and at subsequent
25-cycle intervals. The central region of the facet was tested at 1Hz with
surrounding sites at distances of 2 indentor diameters randomly subjected to
loading frequencies of 5Hz, 20Hz, 40Hz and 80Hz [14]. The maximum deformation
at each cycle interval was computed and averaged across all specimens for each
frequency, initialized to zero at the initial cycle interval and plotted verses
cycle number. The stiffness in the elastic region was computed by performing a
linear regression for load versus deformation using data from the first
complete loading cycle at each cycle count interval.</p>

<p class="body">Stiffness data at each respective cycle count
was subsequently averaged across all specimens for each frequency and plotted
versus cycle number. For each frequency, the cycle strain was computed and
averaged across frequencies for each cycle over all specimens. The cumulative
strain versus cycle number data was also computed. All parameters were
subjected to non-linear exponential regression. The resulting regression
produced the parameters of Yo (initial net deformation), K (rate constant of
net deformation change), Plateau (asymptotic limit of net deformation) and Span
(Yo - Plateau) which were examined using a 1-way ANOVA with a Tukey post-hoc
test for between frequency comparisons. The K values for maximum deformation
were converted to half-life according to the relationship: half-life = ln2/K. 
Half-life in this context represents the number of cycles required to attain
50% of the asymptotic deformation limit or Plateau.</p>

<h4>3. Results</h4>

<p class="body">Figure 2 depicts the net deformation versus
cycle number at each frequency. All comparisons for Plateau values were
statistically significant between frequencies. (P&lt;0.005 all comparisons)</p>

<p class="body">The resulting K value or rate of net deformation
per unit cycle at elevated frequencies (&gt;1Hz) displayed statistically
significant decreases with respect to the 1Hz frequency (Figure 3).</p>

<p class="body">No statistically significant differences between
K values were detected between 5Hz and 40Hz or 80Hz. However the associated K
value with the 20Hz frequency was significantly decreased as compared to the
5Hz frequency. The K value associated with the 20Hz frequency was significantly
different as compared to 80Hz (P&lt;0.05) but not 40Hz.</p>

<p class="body">The asymptotic deformation values or Plateau
achieved by the facet surface based on frequency were statistically
significant. (P&lt;0.005 all comparisons) All elevated frequencies (&gt;1Hz)
displayed statistically significant decreases with respect to K (P&lt;0.05 over
all comparisons). The half-life data for deformation indicates that the 5Hz is
statistically decreased as compared to all other frequencies tested (Figure 4).</p>

<p class="body">The regression results of stiffness versus cycle
number also indicated an exponential relationship. Both the initial stiffness
(Yo) and asymptotic limit of the stiffness (Plateau) increased as the frequency
increased with all comparisons between frequencies statistically significant
(P&lt;0.05 for all). With respect to the Half-Life stiffness data, no
statistically significant differences were found between the 5Hz and 20Hz, or
the 1Hz and 80Hz frequencies. All other comparisons were statistically
significant (P&lt;0.05).</p>

<p class="body">A decrease in the K value (that is, an increased
number of cycles to obtain the asymptotic stiffness limit) was seen as the
frequency increased from 1Hz to 40Hz. At the 80Hz loading frequency, the K
value was comparable to that observed at the 1Hz loading rate.</p>

<p class="body">The cycle strain indicated that both the initial
and asymptotic limit of the strain decreased with increasing frequency (P&lt;0.05
for all comparisons). The K value for strain (or rate of strain change per
cycle) indicated that the 1Hz loading frequency was statistically equivalent to
both the 40Hz and 80Hz frequencies (P&gt;0.05 for both) The 5Hz frequency K
value was statistically increased as compared to all other frequencies (P&lt;0.01
for all comparisons)(Figure 5).</span></p>

<p class="body">For the cumulative strain data, all frequencies
above 1Hz displayed a linear response between strain accumulation and cycle
number whereas at 1Hz frequency an exponential relationship was evident
(P&lt;0.001, F- test)(Figure 6). A statistical comparison of the linear
regression slopes for the elevated frequencies versus the K value for the 1Hz
frequency indicated that all elevated rates were statistically different as
compared to 1Hz loading(P&lt;0.001 for all).</span></p>

<h4>4. Discussion</h4>

<p class="body">In a review of the literature concerning
elevated frequency loading, Hill et al. determined that while studies displayed
deficiencies, vibrations remain an important consideration in evaluation of
patients presenting with discogenic back pain and that long term clinically
controlled studies will be required for a definitive determination of
vibrational effects upon spinal loading [15]. Determination of spinal
resonance frequency is difficult as the frequency response is affected by
multiple factors which include posture, seating, and inclination [6]. Despite
variations in experimental methods, the resonance frequency of the spine has
been cited between 5Hz and 12Hz with the greatest transmission occurring at the
first resonant frequency of 5Hz [6,15].</p>

<p class="body">At these elevated frequencies damping may result
in considerable energy transfer. This was validated in this study by
statistically increased values in initial and asymptotic stiffness values as
loading frequency is elevated (Figure 7).</p>

<figure>
<img src="002_files/007.jpg" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 7. Stiffness Results. The initial stiffness and asymptotic stiffness values increase as the loading frequency increases. All comparisons were statistically significant.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">With increased frequency, increases in initial
stiffness and cycles required to achieve stability (i.e. decreasing K values
for stiffness) were seen. This is in keeping with the work by Wilder et al.,
where stiffening of the spine was reported in response to loading at increasing
frequency. Further, it has been found that structures vibrated at the first
resonant frequency have greater potential for damage [16]. In this study, a
similar finding that 5Hz frequency loading was more often found to be
associated with more detrimental mechanical parameters as compared to the other
elevated frequencies. </span></p>

<p class="body">In this study, the combination of decreasing K
values (for deformation and stiffness respectively) and elevated initial
stiffness may constitute a predisposition in individuals for the onset of facet
joint degeneration. This is significant in that viscous damping may result in
significant energy transfer. At elevated frequencies muscles become fatigued
and require increased time to react to sudden loading thereby making the spine
more susceptible to injury [6]. Guo et al. noted that whole body vibration of
human spine is more dangerous to facets, which may lead to abnormal remodelling
and degeneration of the lumbar spine [9].</span></p>

<p class="body">Bone, as many viscoelastic tissues, increases in
strength with strain rate. While the applied loading is uniform, the reduction
in initial strain due to elevation in frequency results in an increased modulus
or stiffening. The 40Hz and 80Hz frequencies may be acting as a low frequency
or quasi-static condition in that the fluid flow within the tissue has achieved
static equilibrium and hence the viscoelastic effects are comparable to those
at low frequency. </span></p>

<p class="body">The cumulative cycle strain data has clinical
implications in that eventual attainment of a plateau level is attained at 1Hz
while elevated frequencies continue accumulation indefinitely. If one
considers the continued exposure of these elevated frequencies by extrapolating
to several thousand cycles the evidence suggests dramatic and potentially
detrimental conditions regarding the continued strain accumulation. As can be
seen, the elevated frequencies quickly surpass the strain accumulation at the
1Hz frequency by a little as 6000 cycles or less than 2 hours (at 1Hz).</p>

<p class="body">This study indicates that increased strain
accumulation can occur at elevated loading frequencies over prolonged time
periods and do so indefinitely at elevated frequencies. Patients exposed to
occupational vibrations in the 4Hz to 20Hz range experience low back pain rates
twice that of non-exposed patients. Clinically, the mechanical response of the
facet joints is dependent on a variety of specific loading parameters that
include loading magnitude, duration and frequency and as a result low back pain
is a multifaceted condition and cannot be attributed to a single factor. 
However, to minimize overall exposure, one must reduce amplitude, dampen
frequency and reduce time. These parameters will all play a role in the
overall exposure reduction. To that end, these effects can be reduced through
improvements in seat materials, and damping or suspension mechanisms [16].</p>

<h4>5. Conclusions</h4>

<p class="body">This study demonstrates that increased stiffness
at elevated loading frequencies is manifested and may be an indicator of low
back pain propensity. This study presents a mechanical representation of the
facet joint response to high frequency vibration conditions and may be a basis
for determination of low back pain predisposition. Further, subsequent
reduction or damping of these elevated frequencies may aid in clinical care of
those under continuous exposure.</p>
