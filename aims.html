      <h2>Aims and Scopes</h2>
      <p class="body">Avestia Publishing has initiated the publication of the Journal of Biomedical Engineering and Biosciences (JBEB).</p>

      <p class="body">This journal is based on the continuous model in English and adopts the open-access model, meaning all interested audience have free access to the journal's homepage and articles with no need for subscription. This ensures larger audience and therefore higher citations.</p>

      <p class="body">Users are allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of the articles in this journal without asking prior permission from the publisher or the author. This is in accordance with the BOAI definition of open access.</p>

      <p class="body">All published papers of JBEB will be submitted to Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, and Open J-Gate for indexing.</p>

      <p class="body">JBEB welcomes research and review papers related to Biomedical Engineering and Systems including but not limited to the areas of:</p>
